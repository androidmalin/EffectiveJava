# EffectiveJava
Skeletal implementation is a design by which we can use the benefits of the interface and abstract class together.

The Java Collection API has adopted this kind of design: AbstractSet, AbstractMap, etc. are examples of Skeletal interfaces. Also, Joshua Bloch mentions skeletal interfaces in his book “Effective Java.”
